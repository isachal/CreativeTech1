    <h2>Quotes + Analysis</h2>
    <p> <strong>“Arduino makes such work part of the development process, and the “push-back” of the physical electronics - the resistance of reality to our attempts to contain — it is therefore more present.”</strong>
        By using a physical object such as Arduino as opposed to software, this quote establishes that participants will create stronger bonds to the project. The participants are now doubly involved; through the analytical realm but also the physical realm. We generally tend to attach a higher sense of responsibility to physical things as we can visualise what we are responsible for.</p>

    <p>
       <strong>“The ultimate goal of critical making experiences is not the evocative or pedagogical object intended to be experienced by others, but rather the creation of novel understandings by makers themselves”</strong> 
        This shows that “critical making” does not assume a didactic position, it is instead a space for exploration that will lead to different forms of knowledge. Making is used as the process, the tool that allows this knowledge to emerge. </p>

        <p> <strong>“Open design helps bring about a kind of socio-technical literacy that is necessary to reconnect materiality and morality”</strong>
            I like how this quote summarises the purpose of Open Design and how it attempts to address the disconnect we sometimes have with what we create and its implications. As we move to increasingly digital products it is easy to miss the links and distance ourselves from our creations as they become less tangible and we find ourselves needing to analyse novel scenarios we hadn’t previously encountered with physical products.</p>

            <h2>Quotes - "The Hacker Hacked" by Brett Scott</h2>
            <p><strong>"By whistling the correct tone into a telephone handset, he could place free long-distance calls through a chink in the AT&T armour."</strong></p>
            <p>I like the poetics of this quote and how it  eases you into the history of hacking. It illustrates the playfulness and curiosity that are at the heart of this activity. This metaphor also shows the idea of battling and challenging pre-existing systems. </p>

            <p><strong>"Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about systems -- about the world -- from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more interesting things."</strong></p>
            <p>I find interesting how designers have maybe appropriated this methodology. Thinking in terms of systems is an important skill when working on projects that deal with wicked problems in particular. This quote resonates with me and relates to my project called REWARE (how to be more in touch with your electronics). I followed this approach of deconstruction of  electronic objects to better understand their circuits and systems, the hardware circuit and beyond.</p>

            <p><strong>"A hack stripped of anti-conventional intent is not a hack at all. It's just a piece of business innovation."</strong></p>
            <p>I find this to be insightful, as we are encouraged to gentrify provocative radical ideas, the center for growth (the never ending aim of capitalism) will be tied back to the field of business. This quote makes me consider how both may be valuable but have different aims. Is business inovation too strongly limited by its constraints? </p>

            <h2>Quotes - ""What do Prototypes Prototype?" by Houde and Hill</h2>
            <p><strong>"Is a brick a prototype? Thea nser depends on how it is used."</strong></p>
            <p>I really like this examples because it shows our biases when it comes to the legitimacy we give to protoypes. I also like how the text shows the value of testing the weight and scale through the brick. The brick has few visual connotations to detract us from the two factors explored. I think if the object was already designed the appearance might make us consider scale and weight as minor.</p>

            <p><strong>"An interesting side-effect of this prototype was that its directness made it a powerful prop for promoting the project withing the organization"</strong></p>
            <p>This quote points out to the importance of knowing one's audience as well as showing the influence of a high fidelity prototype. As most audiences are most responsive to the "look and feel" category/visual material, it is a great tool to leverage when promoting an idea.</p>

            <p><strong>" Implementation prototypes [...] commonly find their way directly into the final system. Two problems arise from this dynamic: firstly, programs developed mainly to demonstrate feasibility may turn out in the long term to be difficult to maintain and develop, and secondly, their temporary use interfaces may never be properly redesigned before the final system is released.""]</strong></p>
            <p>This is something I personally struggle with in my practice as I don't spontaneously create multiple prototypes, ofter I am stuborn with my ideas. I think overall, this article proposes a structure and categorisation of prototypes that I will assimilate in my practice; I think it will encourage me to explore more aspects of my ideas by segmenting different aspects.</p>
