    <h2>Quotes + Analysis</h2>
    <p> <strong>“Arduino makes such work part of the development process, and the “push-back” of the physical electronics - the resistance of reality to our attempts to contain — it is therefore more present.”</strong>
        By using a physical object such as Arduino as opposed to software, this quote establishes that participants will create stronger bonds to the project. The participants are now doubly involved; through the analytical realm but also the physical realm. We generally tend to attach a higher sense of responsibility to physical things as we can visualise what we are responsible for.</p>

    <p>
        “The ultimate goal of critical making experiences is not the evocative or pedagogical object intended to be experienced by others, but rather the creation of novel understandings by makers themselves”
        This shows that “critical making” does not assume a didactic position, it is instead a space for exploration that will lead to different forms of knowledge. Making is used as the process, the tool that allows this knowledge to emerge. </p>

        <p>“Open design helps bring about a kind of socio-technical literacy that is necessary to reconnect materiality and morality”
            I like how this quote summarises the purpose of Open Design and how it attempts to address the disconnect we sometimes have with what we create and its implications. As we move to increasingly digital products it is easy to miss the links and distance ourselves from our creations as they become less tangible and we find ourselves needing to analyse novel scenarios we hadn’t previously encountered with physical products.</p>
